            <h3>This is a 3 hour light roleplaying MegaGame that is designed for both brand new and advanced RPG players.</h3>
            
            <h2>Please dress in your best 1920s attire, or failing that your Sunday Best.</h3>
            <h3 class="subtitle">Changing rooms will be made available before the event.</h2>
            
            <h5>Complexity choices you can select from:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>Simple Roles:</strong> Designed for players that have never played any RPG or social deduction game before. If you are worried you may mess something up or want a low-stakes fun game where you can still 100% puzzle out the answer and participate, select this role.</li>
                <li> <strong>Complex Roles:</strong> Available to players who play entirely too much D&D, Werewolf, or Blood on the Clocktower. If you have never played a MegaGame before but know how to play Blood or Secret Hitler, select this role. The murderer will be a complex role.</li>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Requests to be paired with other guests and to get simple/complex roles are not guaranteed to be honored. Refunds for Hear/Say cannot be granted less than one week from the event. Please email Contact@puzzalarium.com to request ticket transferring. Dinner is not included, but bringing in outside food is permitted, and could hypothetically be used to bribe other players. Not that we would condone that, but we won't stop you either.</p>
